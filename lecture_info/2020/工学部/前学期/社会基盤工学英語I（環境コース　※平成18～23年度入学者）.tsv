***授業概要:::The students will be working on units from the textbook 'Everyday Ecology'. The text covers important issues about the earth's environment, global warming, recycling, green architecture: living buildings, air pollution and so on.. There is a lot of useful Engineering and Science English vocabulary used throughout the author's writing. Students will be given a short comprehension test about the topics in the textbook halfway through each term.
***到達すべき目標:::The aim of each lesson will be for students to hold short discussions either with a partner or with other class members about the topic of each unit in the textbook - keeping in English. I hope students will gain more confidence in their spoken English.
***授業計画と準備学習:::The plan for each class:  At the start of each class, there will be 10-15 minutes for Question Time on topics relating to general topics that are not covered in the units of the textbook. After this, we will work slowly through the textbook with vocabulary comprehension, listening and discussion.
Also, the students will be put into four groups and will work on a group project involving Eco-friendly civil engineering structures, safe cycling routes, Nature-Links bus routes and International Eco-tourism ideas.
Each group will do a Powerpoint Presentation in English in front of the other students in the class.
It should contain as much interesting and original opinions as possible and the presentations should be creative and spoken simply and clearly. The Powerpoint Presentation can contain computer graphics, photographs, diagrams and graphs labeled in clear simple English.
Group Reports in both English and Japanese should be handed in near the end of the term..

***成績評価の方法:::I grade students on how often they asked and answered questions during each class and on how well they discussed topics in the class. I also take into account attitude towards the teacher and other students. Five times absent from the class will result in the student failing. Regular lateness/sleeping/may also result in failing. An A Grade is awarded to students who very regularly contribute enthusiastically in every class. An S Grade may be awarded to students who have continually shown excellence throughout the whole term.
